# Introduction
Windows Kernel Explorer (you can simply call it as "WKE") is a free but powerful kernel research tool. It supports from Windows XP to Windows 10 (32-bit and 64-bit). Compared to WIN64AST and PCHunter, WKE can run on the latest Windows 10 without updating binary files.

### How WKE works on the latest Windows 10
WKE will automatically download required symbol files if the current system is not supported natively, 90% of the features will work after this step. For some needed data that doesn't exist in symbol files, WKE will try to retrieve them from the DAT file (when new Windows 10 releases, I will upload a new DAT file to GitHub). If WKE cannot access the internet, 50% of the features will still work. Currently, native support is available from Windows XP to Windows 10 RS3; Windows 10 from RS4 to the lastest version are fully supported by parsing symbol files and DAT file.

### How to customize WKE
You can customize WKE by editing the configuration file. Currently, you can specify the device name and symbolic link name of driver, and altitude of filter. You can also enable kernel-mode and user-mode characteristics randomization to avoid being detected by malware. If you rename the EXE file of WKE, then you need to rename SYS/DAT/INI files together with the same name.

### About digital signature and negative comment from Anti-Virus software
Because I don't have a digital certificate, I have to use the leaked digital certificate from HT SRL to sign drivers of WKE. Signing files with the HT SRL digital certificate has a side effect: almost all Anti-Virus software infer files with HT SRL digital signature are malware, because many hackers use it to sign malwares since 2015. Only idiots implant malicious code into a tool for experienced programmers and reverse engineers, because most users only use WKE in test environments, this kind of behavior is meaningless.

### About loading driver unsuccessfully
##### If WKE prompts "unable to load driver", there may be the following reasons:
1. HVCI is enabled.  
2. Anti-Virus software prevents the driver from loading.  
##### Solutions:
1. [Disable HVCI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/device-guard/enable-virtualization-based-protection-of-code-integrity#how-to-turn-off-hvci) or Secure Boot.  
2. Add the files of WKE to the white list of Anti-Virus software.  

### About open source
It is a bit awkward, so I say straightforwardly: I don't plan to share the source code of this tool, but I may share some source code of test programs that associated with this tool.

### About WKE can be detected by Anti-Cheat solutions
I received too many SPAM of this issue. I must declare: WKE is not designed to bypass any Anti-Cheat solution. If you need to use WKE in a specfic environment, please order "binary customization" service.

# Main Features
1. Process management (Module, Thread, Handle, Memory, Window, Windows Hook, etc.)
2. File management (NTFS partition analysis, low-level disk access, etc.)
3. Registry management and HIVE file operation
4. Kernel-mode callback, filter, timer, NDIS blocks and WFP callout functions management
5. Kernel-mode hook scanning (MSR, EAT, IAT, CODE PATCH, SSDT, SSSDT, IDT, IRP, OBJECT)
6. User-mode hook scanning (Kernel Callback Table, EAT, IAT, CODE PATCH)
7. Memory editor and symbol parser (it looks like a simplified version of WINDBG)
8. Hide driver, hide/protect process, hide/protect/redirect file or directory, protect registry and falsify registry data
9. Path modification for driver, process and process module
10. Enable/disable some obnoxious Windows components

# Thanking List
1. Team of WIN64AST: I referenced the UI design and many features of this software.
2. Team of PCHunter: I referenced some features of this software.
3. Team of ProcessHacker: I studied the source code of this software, but I didn't use it in my project.
4. Donald John Trump: Thank for his wonderful performances from 2017 to 2020. When I am troubled with debugging, his news always makes me laugh. Ich hoffe sehr, dass er noch vier Jahre Pr√§sident sein kann.
