# Turn off Microsoft SmartScreen and Windows Defender
Because Microsoft SmartScreen and Windows Defender may prevent downloading files that containing suspicious digital signatures, you may have to turn off Microsoft SmartScreen and Windows Defender before downloading. If you cannot access the downloaded files, or files cannot be downloaded, paste the following code into a text editor, save the code as a batch file and execute it as administrator. After restarting, this page will be opened again.

Off topic: This version was originally planned to be released on June 1, but due to the Killing of George Floyd, my attention was attracted, which led to the release of this version 10 days later than the original plan. George Floydâ€™s death is a tragedy, but this is just one of countless tragedies that have been caused since the establishment of the United States. The US government is oppressing the American people, slaughtering the people of the Middle East, committing economic terrorism against countries that refuse to cooperate with it, and bullying European countries. It has caused much more harm to all mankind than Nazi Germany and Communism Soviet Union. Only when this evil regime is completely destroyed can cease such tragedies to occur.
